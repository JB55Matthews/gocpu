A MIPS CPU Emulated in GO
---------------------------
A processor for MIPS emulated in Go. All components reduce down to simple gate structs, using no internal logic except gate connections. This makes this a full "emulation", and not simulated processor.

This is in early stages of being developed, so this is still very bare.
